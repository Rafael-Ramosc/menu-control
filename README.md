I was thinking about a game menu selection, and I was wondering if I could make something like.

This is the attempt I made, but I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it.

TO-DO: 

- [x] Create a "common" for functions like to create format of the text or maybe some pre existing crates that could help me with this.
